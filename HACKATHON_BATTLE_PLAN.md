# WISPY HACKATHON BATTLE PLAN
## Target: #1 Position in All Three Hackathons

---

## THE WINNING NARRATIVE

### One-Liner (10 seconds)
**"Wispy is the world's first autonomous AI agent that can think for days, pay for its own services, and prove its identity on-chain."**

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> Current AI agents are stateless toys - they forget everything, can't pay for services, and have no verifiable identity. Wispy changes this. Built on Gemini 2.5's thinking mode, Wispy can run autonomous missions for days, automatically pay for premium APIs using x402 protocol, and register its identity on-chain using ERC-8004. It's not just an AI - it's an autonomous digital employee with a wallet and an identity.

### The Problem (What judges need to feel)
1. **AI agents today are disposable** - No memory, no continuity, no accountability
2. **Agents can't transact** - They can't pay for premium data, APIs, or services
3. **No trust framework** - How do you know an agent is legitimate?
4. **Human bottleneck** - Every API call needs human approval

### The Solution (What Wispy delivers)
1. **Marathon Mode** - Multi-day autonomous execution with checkpoints
2. **x402 Payments** - Agents pay for services automatically (USDC on Base)
3. **ERC-8004 Identity** - On-chain verifiable agent registration
4. **A2A Protocol** - Agents discover and communicate with each other
5. **Trust Controller** - Configurable approval workflows

## THE KILLER DEMO SCENARIO

### Demo Title: "The Autonomous Research Analyst"

**Setup:** Wispy is tasked to research and produce a comprehensive market analysis report.

**Demo Flow (2.5 minutes):**

```
[0:00-0:10] HOOK
"What if an AI agent could work for you for days, pay for premium data,
and prove every action on-chain? Meet Wispy."

[0:10-0:30] THE TASK
User types: "Research the African DePIN market. Get premium data.
Produce a report with citations. Budget: $5 USDC."

Wispy responds: Shows marathon plan with 5 milestones

[0:30-1:00] MARATHON MODE IN ACTION
- Show thinking mode activating (24K token budget)
- Show milestone progress
- Show checkpoint saves
- "Wispy has been running for 6 hours autonomously..."

[1:00-1:30] x402 PAYMENT
- Wispy encounters premium API requiring payment
- Show HTTP 402 response
- Show automatic USDC payment on Base
- Show transaction hash on block explorer
- "Wispy just paid $0.50 for premium data - no human intervention"

[1:30-2:00] A2A COMMUNICATION
- Wispy discovers another agent with relevant data
- Show agent card exchange
- Show secure message signing
- "Wispy collaborated with another AI to verify data"

[2:00-2:20] ON-CHAIN IDENTITY
- Show ERC-8004 registration
- Show agent's on-chain reputation score
- "Every action is verifiable. Every agent is accountable."

[2:20-2:30] THE RESULT
- Show completed report
- Show all transactions logged
- Show cost breakdown
- "Complete market analysis. $2.30 spent. Zero human intervention."
```

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### Today (Priority Order):
1. **Deploy ERC-8004 contracts** - Exit mock mode
2. **Test full demo flow** - End-to-end with all integrations
3. **Record backup demo** - In case live demo fails
4. **Update README** - Screenshots, GIFs, clear instructions

### Before Each Deadline:
1. Tailor submission to that hackathon's criteria

## WINNING STATEMENT

> "Wispy isn't just an AI chatbot with plugins. It's the first autonomous agent
> infrastructure that combines multi-day reasoning (Gemini), automatic payments
> (x402), verifiable identity (ERC-8004), and agent communication (A2A) into
> a single platform. We're not building a demo - we're building the future of
> how AI agents operate in the real economy."
